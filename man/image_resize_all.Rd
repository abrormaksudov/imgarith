\title{Resize Multiple Images to Matching Dimensions}
\usage{
image_resize_all(..., match_to = "mean", width = NULL, height = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Two or more image objects (magick format) to be resized}

\item{match_to}{Either 'mean' (default) to use average dimensions of all images,
or a positive integer N to match dimensions of the Nth image}

\item{width}{Optional. Target width in pixels (must be positive).
If NULL, width is determined by match_to setting}

\item{height}{Optional. Target height in pixels (must be positive).
If NULL, height is determined by match_to setting}
}
\value{
A vector of magick image objects, all resized to the same dimensions
}
\description{
Resizes multiple images to consistent dimensions. The target dimensions can be:
\enumerate{
\item mean dimensions of all input images
\item dimensions of a specific image from the input set
\item custom user-specified dimensions
}
}
\details{
The function enforces aspect ratio changes to ensure all images match exactly.
This means images may appear stretched or compressed if their original aspect
ratios differ significantly from the target dimensions. The '!' in the resize
specification forces exact dimensions without preserving aspect ratio.

Negative dimensions are converted to their absolute values with a warning.
Invalid dimensions (zero or non-numeric) are ignored with a warning.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load two images
img1 <- magick::image_read("path/to/image1.jpg")
img2 <- magick::image_read("path/to/image2.jpg")

# Resize to mean dimensions
resized <- image_resize_all(img1, img2)

# Resize to match first image
resized <- image_resize_all(img1, img2, match_to = 1)

# Resize to specific dimensions
resized <- image_resize_all(img1, img2, width = 800, height = 600)
}
